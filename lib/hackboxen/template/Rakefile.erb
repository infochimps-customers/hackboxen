task :get_data do
  #
  # This task is intended to pull data down from a source. Examples include
  # the web, an ftp server, and Amazon's simple storage service (s3). As much
  # as possible this should be the only task that interacts with the 'outside'
  # world.

task :default => ['hb:create_working_config', 'hb:icss', 'hb:endpoint', :get_data, 'hb:init']
#
# hb:create_working_config makes establishes all required directories and serializes out all
# configuration options into env/working_config.json. This task is required.
#
# hb:icss copies over the icss.yaml file if it exists into its proper place in fixd/data. This
# task is not required.
#
# hb:endpoint copies over the endpoint.rb file if it exists into its proper place in fixd/code.
# This task is not required.
#
# :get_data is explained above. This task (and any other dependent tasks you wish to write) are
# expected only to pull data into the ripd directory, nothing more. This task is required.
#
# hb:init executes the main file located in engine. This task is required.
